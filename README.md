## Island Dashboard 
The goal of this assignment is to scope, design, implement and document a data dashboard for an island that addresses the key challenges of said island. The design of the dashboard and its functionality should come from the student; however, you will be introduced to the following tools throughout the course and it is suggested you use one of these: 
- *Gradio*
- *Streamlit*
- *Panel*
- *iPyWidget*
- *Dash* 

Other libraries may be used with instructor permission.

Students should use version control for this assignment, both to demonstrate good practice, to demonstrate authorship and to prevent any loss of code or work. You will be provided a repository for your final project on the Queen Mary Enterprise GitHub server. Commit regularly – a branch will be duplicated from the main branch at the deadline above. If you are unable to submit via GitHub, there will be a backup submission point on QM Plus. If you submit this way, please zip your folder and submit. Ensure you include the .git subfolder - just downloading from the GitHub page will not have this by default. Your application must include the code to make the notebook work in either .py  or .ipynb and all requirements, either in a *requirements.txt* file or *pyproject.toml* file. Assets can be included in the ZIP file – it is also possible to use a bash script command to retrieve these.  

*Please replace this readme file with project documentation.*

## Introduction, Scope and Context (30%) 
You should set the scope of the dashboard, discussing any datasets or databases you will be using (provenance - where they came from, how they came to be collected) and any work needed to get the data in a usable format (cleaning) or to store it before analysis (use of databases, application programming interfaces or data stored in various file formats). You may use any responsibly-sourced data for this project; it is also possible to use synthetic (i.e. fake) data if appropriate, though this may affect the following section. It is worth looking for similar projects in your area, both to provide context and to give you ideas for the analysis and implementation. You should discuss and justify your choice of libraries and tools.
## Methodology and Data Analysis (30%) 
You should talk about and demonstrate your analysis methods and approaches to visualisation here. While the quality of data available will depend on your project, you should be able to demonstrate statistics at the level of collections and subcollections. You should consider what types of visualisations will best convey your insights, and how these will be accessible to your audience. You should also ensure your work is reproducible and that algorithms or formulas used for calculations are documented. 
## Design and Implementation (30%) 
You should show how you constructed the dashboard, demonstrating both the visual and code design. A dashboard implies either interactivity or up-to-date data; ideally, you should include both. This means your dashboard should be interactive and responsive, accommodating different types of users. It should also be updatable, should new data be available. Version control should be used to track the development of new features against documented requirements. You should show knowledge of the classes and methods of libraries used, extending functionality where appropriate. 
## Recommendation, Reflection and Conclusions (10%) 
While this part alone is worth the least number of marks, this is critical for showing the learning that occurred during your work on the assignment, and effective completion of this section will allow you to get more marks in earlier sections. You should link your work to relevant knowledge, skills and behaviour from the apprenticeship, and ensure the marker has everything they need to use and evaluate your code.
